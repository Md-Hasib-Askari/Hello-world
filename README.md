# Hello-world
I don't know what to do. But doing what's in guide.
I am a student and have a great life of learning anti-textual matters.
Well, my aim is to be a software engineer but for now I will be happy if I can make myself a web developer. In future, I will try my best to be a Software Engineer.
By the way, my best friend of all is my one and only Allah.
